# NFT Upgrade System

## Project Description

The NFT Upgrade System is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to upgrade their Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using native resources. This system introduces a gamification layer to NFTs by allowing owners to enhance their digital assets' attributes, level, and overall value through strategic upgrades using AptosCoin.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the NFT ecosystem by introducing dynamic, upgradeable digital assets that evolve over time. Instead of static NFTs, we aim to create living digital collectibles that can grow in power, rarity, and value through user investment and engagement. This system bridges the gap between traditional collectibles and modern gaming mechanics, creating a more interactive and engaging NFT experience.
